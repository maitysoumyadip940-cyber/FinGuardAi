## 🎯 What is FinGuard AI?

FinGuard AI is a **UTR Transaction Risk Lookup** application built around a transaction dataset containing **15,000 synthetic/demo records**.

A user enters a UTR ID, and the application:

1. Searches the local transaction dataset.
2. Retrieves the matching transaction.
3. Displays a **0–100 risk score**.
4. Assigns a risk level.
5. Shows transaction, device, network, behavioural and security attributes.
6. Displays the recorded fraud-risk reason.

The current lookup application is a **working front-end/demo implementation**. The larger AI fraud-detection architecture described below is the proposed production direction for the project.

---

## ✨ Current Application Features

### 🔎 UTR Lookup

Enter a UTR ID such as:

```text
UTR26082400001107
```

The application searches the embedded transaction dataset and returns the matching record.

### 📊 Risk Score

Each transaction contains a recorded `Risk_Score_0_100` value.

The current application uses these thresholds:

| Score | Risk Level |
|---:|---|
| `< 30` | 🟢 Low Risk |
| `30–69` | 🟡 Medium Risk |
| `≥ 70` | 🔴 High Risk |

### 🧾 Transaction Details

The lookup result can display:

- Transaction ID
- Fraud / Genuine label
- Amount
- Payment method
- Sender
- Receiver
- UPI ID
- Card token
- Timestamp
- City
- State
- Network type
- Device type
- Device trust
- Beneficiary type
- Previous transactions with receiver
- Transaction frequency
- Time pattern
- Location pattern
- Authentication signal
- Network risk
- Account security
- Behaviour pattern

### 🧠 Risk Explanation

Each dataset record contains a `Fraud_Risk_Reason` field, which is displayed with the transaction result.

### 📱 Responsive Interface

The current interface is designed as a lightweight responsive web page with a dark fintech-style visual design.

### 💻 Prerequisites / Browser Support

No installation, build step, or backend is required to run the current demo.

- Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari — latest two versions)
- JavaScript enabled
- No internet connection required after the page is loaded, since the dataset is embedded client-side
- Optional: Python 3 (or any static file server) if you prefer serving the file over `http://` instead of opening it directly via `file://`

---

## 🧪 Example

Example transaction lookup:

```text
UTR ID
UTR26082400001107

Transaction
TXN26082400001107

Label
Fraud

Risk Score
85 / 100

Risk Level
HIGH RISK

Reason
Authentication and velocity anomalies
```

> The dataset is synthetic/demo data and should not be treated as real financial transaction data.

---

## 🏗️ Current Implementation

The current uploaded application is intentionally lightweight:

```text
index.html
README.md
```

The main application is contained in a single self-contained HTML file.

### Current architecture

```text
                ┌──────────────────────┐
                │      User / UI       │

                └──────────┬───────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                ┌──────────────────────┐
                │ Risk Score + Details │
                └──────────┬───────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                ┌──────────────────────┐
                │ Risk Result Display  │
                └──────────────────────┘
```

The application creates a lookup map from the embedded records and matches the entered UTR against `UTR_ID`.

## 🤖 Proposed AI Fraud-Detection Architecture

For the full FinGuard AI vision, the proposed architecture places the fraud engine between a payment gateway and the bank/core system.

```text
UPI / CARD TRANSACTION
          │
          ▼
     API GATEWAY
          │
          ▼
  FEATURE EXTRACTION
          │
          ▼
      AI FRAUD MODEL
          │
          ▼
   RISK SCORING ENGINE
          │
     ┌────┼────┐
     ▼    ▼    ▼
   ALLOW FLAG BLOCK
```

### Detection approach

The proposed system combines:

- **Supervised machine learning**
- **Anomaly detection**
- **Rule-based detection**
- **Behavioural profiling**
- **Continuous 0–100 risk scoring**
- **Feedback-driven adaptive learning**

The HyperFusion 2026 proposal identifies:

- XGBoost / Random Forest for supervised classification
- Autoencoder / Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- FastAPI / Flask for inference APIs
- Kafka for event streaming
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL for storage
- AWS / cloud deployment
- React.js for the application interface
- OAuth2 / encryption for security

These technologies describe the **proposed architecture**, not all components currently implemented in the uploaded demo.

     ├── 0–29   → ALLOW
     ├── 30–69  → FLAG / REVIEW
     └── 70–100 → BLOCK
```

> These proposed boundaries match the Low / Medium / High thresholds used in the current demo (see [Risk Score](#-risk-score)) so the two stay consistent as the project evolves.

If you later split the application into a frontend/backend architecture, the repository can evolve into:

```text

├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── ml/
├── data/
├── assets/
└── README.md
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1 — Open directly

The current application is self-contained.

Open:

```text
index.html
```

in a modern web browser.

### Option 2 — Run with a local web server

From the project directory:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 🔍 Dataset

The current demo contains:

```text
15,000 transaction records
```

The records include UTR IDs, transaction IDs, labels, amounts, payment methods, sender/receiver information, timestamps, location, device/network attributes, behavioural signals, risk scores and fraud-risk reasons.

**Important:** The supplied dataset is explicitly described as **synthetic/demo data**. It must not be interpreted as real customer or banking data.

---

## 🎨 UI Design

The current interface follows a dark fintech dashboard style with:

- Dark navy background
- Blue primary actions
- Green low-risk indicators
- Amber medium-risk indicators
- Red high-risk indicators
- Transaction result cards
- Risk score presentation
- Responsive layout

The visual direction is intended to communicate a **financial-security / fraud-monitoring** product rather than a generic data lookup page.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Being transparent about the current demo's scope:

- **No real detection logic.** Risk scores and reasons are pre-computed values stored in the dataset, not the output of a live model — the app performs lookup and display only.
- **No backend or persistence.** Everything runs client-side in the browser; there is no API, database, or server component yet.
- **Not built for real transactions.** The dataset is synthetic and the app has no authentication, encryption, or audit logging — it is not suitable for production or real financial data.
- **Single-file architecture.** `index.html` currently contains markup, styles, and the embedded dataset together, which will need to be split out as the project grows (see [Project Structure](#-project-structure)).

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I look up a real transaction?**
No. The dataset is 15,000 synthetic/demo records — it contains no real customer or banking data.

**Q: Does this actually detect fraud in real time?**
Not yet. The current app looks up a pre-scored record by UTR. Real-time detection is described in [Proposed AI Fraud-Detection Architecture](#-proposed-ai-fraud-detection-architecture) as the intended production direction.

**Q: Do I need to install anything to try it?**
No — see [Prerequisites / Browser Support](#-prerequisites--browser-support). Just open `index.html` in a browser.

**Q: Where do I find a sample UTR to try?**
See the [Example](#-example) section for a sample UTR ID and its expected result.
